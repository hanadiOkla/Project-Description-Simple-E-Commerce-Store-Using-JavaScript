Project Description: Simple E-Commerce Store Using JavaScript



============================================================*/


In this project, I applied all the core concepts I learned during a JavaScript course to build a simplified version of a popular application â€” an e-commerce store. The main goal was to reinforce my understanding of JavaScript, while practicing and improving my programming skills through a real-world, hands-on example. The app includes interactive features such as product display, shopping cart management, and page navigation using modern programming techniques. This experience helped me enhance my performance, deepen my grasp of the language, and prepare for more advanced projects in the future.
